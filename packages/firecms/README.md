Designed by developers for developers, FireCMS is a headless CMS and admin panel
that seamlessly integrates with **Firebase and Firestore** by default, but is
also compatible with any backend.

Effortlessly generate **CRUD views** based on your configuration. FireCMS is
simple to set up for standard cases and easy to extend and customize for more specific
needs.

Built to produce collection and form views that naturally align with the
collection/document model, FireCMS covers a wide range of basic and advanced use
cases. With extensibility in mind, it's easy to create your own views or modify
existing ones.

FireCMS does **not impose any data structure** restrictions, ensuring a smooth,
out-of-the-box experience for any project.
