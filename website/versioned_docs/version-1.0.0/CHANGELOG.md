### Added

- New custom login screen that replaces FirebaseUi.
- Replaced `react-csv` with custom CSV implementation
- The previous changes were blocking SSR and build tools such as Vite, but more
  testing is needed.
- New type added `EntitySchemaResolver`, used mostly internally for resolving
  entity schemas (that means computing the property builders and transforming
  them to a `ResolvedEntitySchema`)

### Changed

- Fix for collections not refreshing correctly
- [BREAKING] `schemaResolver` at the `FireCMS` level has been renamed to
  `schemaOverrideHandler`.

## [1.0.0-beta5] - 2021-11-22

### Added

- `snackbarController` added to `FireCMSContext` so it can be used in callbacks.
- `width` parameter added to `SideEntityController`'s `open` function, so you

## [1.0.0-beta4] - 2021-11-14

### Added

- Added additional props to `NavigationBuilder` and `Authenticator`, including
  `dataSource` and `storageSource`. These are useful if you need to fetch some
  data from your datasource (such as if you want to check if a logged user has
  an entry in Firestore) and apply the corresponding permissions or navigation.
- Added `SelectionController` to `EntityCollectionView`. You can use
  `useSelectionController` and pass it your custom `EntityCollectionView`
  if you want to control the selected entities. If you are
  using `FirebaseCMSApp` as an entry point, you can define your
  `Autheticator` as:

```tsx
import { User as FirebaseUser } from "firebase/auth";
const myAuthenticator: Authenticator<FirebaseUser> = async ({ user, authController }) => {
    console.log("Allowing access to", user?.email);
    // ...
    return true;
};
```

- Implemented dark mode for markdown fields
- Column sizes and collections tables are now persisted in local storage

### Changed

- The `User` types have been replaced by generics all through the app. Types
  like `AuthController` or `NavigationBuilder` now have a generic argument that
  allows to define the user type. In the case of
- Internal work around to prevent collections going back to the start due to
  Firestore returning incomplete collection data.
- [BREAKING] `useCollectionFetch` now uses `sortBy` in the format
  `[Extract<keyof M, string>, "asc" | "desc"]` for consistency
- [BREAKING] `extraActions` in `EntityCollection` now
  receives `selectionController` instead of `selectedEntities`.
- Fix for filters in tables including `enumValues`

## [1.0.0-beta3] - 2021-11-07

### Changed

- `EntityCollectionTable` has been renamed to `EntityCollectionView`
- Reference visual fix
  [144](https://github.com/Camberi/firecms/issues/144)

  [146](https://github.com/Camberi/firecms/issues/146)
- Hiding correctly `hidden` properties if they are in a `MapProperty

### Added

- New `Table` component used internally by `CollectionTable`. `Table` is not
  coupled with our entities and collections models and can be used as a single
  component. It includes generic sorting and filtering capabilities.

## [1.0.0-beta2] - 2021-10-07

### Changed

- When copying an entity the permission used is `create` now, instead of `edit`.
- Fix for entities not being saved when new or copy was clicked
- Fix for multiple delete keeping old state.
- Fix multiple form styles.
- Fix for array of number enums.

### Added

Added `hidden` configuration to disabled fields:

```tsx
buildProperty({
    dataType: "string",
    title: "Hidden field",
    disabled: {
        hidden: true,
    },
});
```

## [1.0.0-beta1] - 2021-10-01

Many **breaking changes** in this version unfortunately, but it's for the
better!
We have done a lot of internal refactorings with the primary goal of making
internal and external APIs more predictable and consistent.

You can find a list of all the changes and help
in [Migrating from alpha versions](https://firecms.co/docs/migrating_from_alpha_versions)

## [0.50.0] - 2021-08-15

### Changed

- Added post process to storage metadata. @zhigang1992 thanks!
- Disabling add button on disabled array properties

## [0.49.1] - 2021-08-15

### Changed

- Fix for broken custom entity views and new entities.

## [0.49.0] - 2021-08-13

### Changed

[BREAKING] Big types refactor. **This only affects you if you use Typescript.**

All the key signatures affecting schemas (`EntitySchema` and related) have
changed from `EntitySchema<Key extends string = string>`
to `EntitySchema<M>` where `M` is simply your model, though you can omit it.

You are now encouraged to define your model like:

```tsx
type Product = {
    name: string;
    price: number;
};
const productSchema = buildSchema<Product>({
    // ...
    properties: {
        name: {
            dataType: "string",
            // ...
        },
        // ...
    },
    // ...
});
```

If you would still like to use inferred types from schemas using something like
`typeof productSchema`, you can still do it if you wrap it in a new type
`InferSchemaType`, but this is not encouraged. In the previous
example `InferSchemaType<typeOf productSchema>` is the same type as `Product`.

Related changes:

- Wherever you had defined your own schema, using `buildSchema()`
  and where using that as a type parameter, it can be changed to the defined
  type or just removed.
- `buildSchemaFrom` has been deleted since now it's identical to `buildSchema`

## [0.48.0] - 2021-08-13

### Changed

- Fix for changes in forms not updating correctly when a real time update
  happened in Firestore
- Fix for popup view position
- Fix for popup view validating only the corresponding cell and not the whole
  property, which was provoking unfixable saving errors.

## [0.47.0] - 2021-08-10

### Changed

- [BREAKING] `EntityCustomViewBuilder` has been renamed to `EntityCustomView`
- Big form performance enhancements

## [0.45.0] - 2021-07-19

### Added

- New `oneOf` field in `ArrayProperty`. This new configuration allows the user
  to build complex array of objects structures, where the object is determined
  by a discriminator or `type` field and stored in the `value` field (both those
  fields are customizable). You can se an example of this in the content
  of [blog entries in the demo](https://demo.firecms.co/c/blog)
- You can now add custom views to your entity schemas, that get rendered next to
  the entity form. You can use these views for anything you need, such as
  rendering a custom form, building a dashboard or displaying a post preview.
- The `collectionPath` and app `context` props have been added
  to `PermissionBuilder` so you can get better info of the context of an entity.

### Changed

- Subcollection views and new schema custom views are now displayed side by side
  when you open the tabs in the side view (useful for better context switching)
- The markdown component has been replaced by a better one.
- Many bugfixes in the form popup view and enhanced behaviour. You can now keep
  a popup open and continue editing other fields. The popup doesn't close
  automatically now when you click on a different cell.

### Changed

- Big internal refactor to have a better modularised code, also to generate
  better docs

### Changed

- [BREAKING] Change EntityStatus from JS enum to TS type. This only affects you
  if you are using a save callback.

  the `ArrayProperty`)

### Changed

- The popup form field in the table now has a save button instead of saving
  automatically.

      content, but the inline editing is disabled. The side panel is still
      enabled.

### Changed

- [BREAKING] The custom fields API has been refactored and simplified. The
  Formik props have been abstracted away and only the relevant fields are
  exposed. You can find the new
  props [here](https://github.com/Camberi/firecms/blob/v1/src/form/form_props.tsx)

  the entity is created) or `on_update` (every time it is saved)
- Markdown field with preview for string properties. Set the flag `markdown` to
  true in the CMS field config.
- Drag and drop feature for default arrays, allowing reorder

### Changed

- Reference field do not need to provide a schema or filter or search delegate
  of the target collection. All these properties are inferred from the
  collection path and the corresponding collection view. So setting an absolute
  path such as
  `products` will look into that path and find the corresponding view.
