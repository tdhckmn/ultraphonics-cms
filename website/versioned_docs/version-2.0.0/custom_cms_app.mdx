You only need to build a custom FireCMS app if you need a high degree of
customization, like custom layouts, data source or storage source adaptations
or special navigation or routing.
Most use-cases are covered by the basic set-up. If you are getting
started with FireCMS, it is recommended to follow the
[quickstart](quickstart.mdx)
:::

FireCMS was originally developed to create Firebase/Firestore-based CMS apps
with very little effort. We offer sensible defaults and multiple customization
options and callbacks.

The simpler way to use FireCMS is using the component `FirebaseCMSApp`, which
is in charge of navigation, initialising Firebase auth, storage and a
Firestore datasource.

But there are a few situations where you may want to have more control and build
your app using the same components that we use internally.

In that case you will want to use `FireCMS` as your main component, and inject
all your dependencies.

In the process of having a cleaner code, all the code related to Firebase has
been isolated into 3 components, one for authentication (auth delegate), one
for the data source and one for storage. These components are abstracted away
behind their respective interfaces. This means you can replace any of those
services with your custom implementation!

For this reason we expose many of the components used internally, so you can
use them in your app and combine them with your code

Some top-level components that you will find useful (same ones as used
by `FirebaseCMSApp`):

- [`FireCMS`]
- [`Scaffold`]
- [`NavigationRoutes`]
- [`SideDialogs`]
- [`useInitialiseFirebase`]
- [`useFirebaseAuthController`]
- [`useFirebaseStorageSource`]
- [`useFirestoreDataSource`]

You will also be responsible for initialising your MUI5 theme and your react-router
`Router`

### Example custom app

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import MyComponentSource from "!!raw-loader!../../samples/samples_v2/CustomCMSApp";

<CodeBlock language="tsx">{MyComponentSource}</CodeBlock>
