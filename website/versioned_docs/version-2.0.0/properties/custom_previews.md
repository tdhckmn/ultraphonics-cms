Every property you define in the CMS as a preview component associated by
default. In some cases you may want to build a custom preview component.

Just as you can customize how your property field is rendered, you can change
how the preview of a property is displayed in collection and other read only
views.

You can build your preview as a React component that takes
[PropertyPreviewProps] as props.

`PropertyPreviewProps` has two generic types: the first one is the type of the
property, such as `string` or `boolean` and the second one (optional) is the
type for any custom props you would like to pass to the preview, just like
done when defining custom fields.

### Example

Example of a custom preview for a `boolean` property:

```tsx
import React, { ReactElement } from "react";
import { PropertyPreviewProps } from "@firecms/core";

import CheckBoxOutlineBlank from "@mui/icons-material/CheckBoxOutlineBlank";
import CheckBoxOutlined from "@mui/icons-material/CheckBoxOutlined";

export default function CustomBooleanPreview({
                                                 value, property, size
                                             }: PropertyPreviewProps
                                             <boolean>)
     {
    return (
        value ? <CheckBoxOutlined/> : <CheckBoxOutlineBlank/>
    );
}
```

...and how it is used:

```tsx
export const blogCollection = buildCollection({
    name: "Blog entry",
    properties: {
        // ...
        reviewed: {
            name: "Reviewed",
            dataType: "boolean",
            Preview: CustomBooleanPreview,
        },
    },
});
```
