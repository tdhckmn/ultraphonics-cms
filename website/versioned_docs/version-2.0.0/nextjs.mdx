It is perfectly possible to use FireCMS with Next.js. FireCMS is a React library, so you can use it with any React
framework.

In the case of next.js, you are restricted to running FireCMS in the client side,
as next.js does not support server side rendering of some of the React components used by FireCMS.

Start by creating your next.js project:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest
```

Then install FireCMS and its dependencies:

```bash
yarn add firecms@^2.0.0 firebase@^9 @mui/material@^5 @mui/icons-material@^5 @mui/lab@latest @mui/x-date-pickers@^5.0.0-beta.1 @emotion/react @emotion/styled react-router@^6 react-router-dom@^6
```

## Configuring the App router

Next.js uses a file based router. In this guide, we will be creating the FireCMS
app in the `/cms` route, but you can customize this to your needs.

FireCMS uses react-router, so we need to configure next.js to delegate
all the routes starting with `/cms` to FireCMS.

FireCMS does not require tailwind since it relies on Material UI, so you can opt-out of it
when creating the project.

In our `app` folder, we create a folder called `cms` and inside it another one called
`[[...any]]`. This will match any route starting with `/cms`.

Then create the file `cms/[[...any]]/page.tsx` with the following content:

```tsx
import CMS from "@/app/cms/CMS";

export default function Home() {
    return <CMS />;
}
```

## Creating the CMS

You can now create your CMS as you would normally do. Create the file `cms/CMS.tsx` with the following content:

:::important
If you are not running FireCMS in the root path of you app, you need to set the `basePath` prop to the path where you
are running it. In this case, we are running it in `/cms`.
:::

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import MyComponentSource from "!!raw-loader!../../samples/samples_v2/nextjs.tsx";

<CodeBlock language="tsx">{MyComponentSource}</CodeBlock>

## Run

Then simply run:

```
yarn dev
```
