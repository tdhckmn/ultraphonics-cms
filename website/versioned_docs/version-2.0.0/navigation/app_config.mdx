When creating a FireCMS app, you will **either** be using the components:

- `FirebaseCMSApp` Default implementation of FireCMS that uses Firebase Auth, Firestore
  and Firebase Storage.
- `FireCMSApp` Lower level component that allows you to provide your own implementations
  of the different services and more customization.

### Navigation

FireCMS takes care of the navigation for you, it generates routes and menus based
on the configuration that you set up.

:::tip
The collections can be defined asynchronously, so you can fetch data from your backend
to build them.
It might be useful if you want to build the collections based on the logged-in user,
or if you want to fetch some data to build the schema of your collections.
Check the [dynamic collections](../collections/dynamic_collections.md) section for more information.
:::

You have two main ways of creating the top level views in FireCMS, either creating entity
collections that get mapped to CMS views, or create your own top level React views:

- Check all the possible configurations for defining [collections](../collections/collections.md)
- Otherwise, you can define your own [custom top level views](./custom_top_level_views.mdx).

### Customization

Let's see all the customization options available for `FirebaseCMSApp` (most
of them are also available for `FireCMSApp`).

- `name`: Name of the app, displayed as the main title and in the tab title

- `logo` Logo to be displayed in the drawer of the CMS.
  If not specified, the FireCMS logo will be used

- `logoDark` Logo used in dark mode. If not specified, `logo` will always be used.

- `collections` List of the mapped collections in the CMS.
  Each entry relates to a collection in the root database.
  Each of the navigation entries in this field
  generates an entry in the main menu.
  You can use a builder to generate the list of collections, based on the logged user

- `views` Custom additional views created by the developer, added to the main
  navigation

- `fields` Record of custom form fields to be used in the CMS.
  You can use the key to reference the custom field in
  the `propertyConfig` prop of a property in a collection.

- `authentication` Do the users need to log in to access the CMS.
  You can specify an Authenticator function to discriminate which users can
  access the CMS or not.
  If not specified, authentication is enabled but no user restrictions
  apply

- `signInOptions` List of sign in options that will be displayed in the login
  view if `authentication` is enabled. You can pass Firebase providers strings,
  such as `firebase.auth.GoogleAuthProvider.PROVIDER_ID` or include additional
  config such as scopes or custom parameters
  Defaults to Google sign in only.

- `allowSkipLogin` If authentication is enabled, allow the user to access the content
  without login.

- `firebaseConfig` Firebase configuration of the project. If you afe deploying the app to
  Firebase hosting, you don't need to specify this value

- `onFirebaseInit` Optional callback after Firebase has been initialised. Useful for
  using the local emulator or retrieving the used configuration.

- `appCheckOptions`Use this to enable Firebase App Check

- `primaryColor`Primary color of the theme of the CMS

- `secondaryColor` Secondary color of the theme of the CMS

- `fontFamily` Font family string
  e.g.'"Roboto", "Helvetica", "Arial", sans-serif'

- `toolbarExtraWidget` A component that gets rendered on the upper side of the main toolbar

- `dateTimeFormat` Format of the dates in the CMS.
  Defaults to 'MMMM dd, yyyy, HH:mm:ss'

- `locale` Locale of the CMS, currently only affecting dates

- `textSearchController` Use this controller to return text search results as document ids, that
  get then fetched from Firestore.

- `basePath` Path under the navigation routes of the CMS will be created. Defaults to `/`.
  Internally FireCMS uses `react-router` to create the routes, the base path is attached to the
  `BrowserRouter` component. If you are using FireCMS in a subpath of your website, you can use
  this prop to specify the base path.

- `baseCollectionPath` Path under the collection routes of the CMS will be created.
  Defaults to `/c`.

- `HomePage` In case you need to override the home page.
  You may want to use `useNavigationContext` in order to get the resolved
  navigation.

- `LoginView` Additional props passed to the login view. You can use this props
  to disable registration in `password` mode, or to set up an additional
  message. Also, to add additional views to the login screen or disable
  the buttons.

- `onAnalyticsEvent` Callback used to get analytics events from the CMS

- `plugins` Use plugins to modify the behaviour of the CMS.
  Currently, in ALPHA, and likely subject to change.

- `autoOpenDrawer`Open the drawer on hover. Defaults to `false`
