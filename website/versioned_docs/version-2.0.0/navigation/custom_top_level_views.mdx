title: Custom top level views
---

If you need to develop a custom view that does not map directly to a Firestore
collection you can implement it as a React component.

You need to define the name, route and the component, and add it to the main
navigation, as the example below.

By default, it will show in the main navigation view.

For custom views you can define the following props:

- `path` string

    CMS Path you can reach this view from.
    If you include multiple paths, only the first one will be included in the
    main menu

- `name`: string

    Name of this view

- `description`?: string

    Optional description of this view. You can use Markdown

- `hideFromNavigation`?: boolean

    Should this view be hidden from the main navigation panel.
    It will still be accessible if you reach the specified path

- `view`: React.ReactNode

    Component to be rendered. This can be any React component, and can use any
    of the provided hooks

- `group`?: string

    Optional field used to group top level navigation entries under a
    navigation view.

### Example:

A quick example for a custom view:

```tsx
import { buildCollection, CMSView, EntityCollectionsBuilder, FirebaseCMSApp } from "@firecms/core";
import { ExampleCMSView } from "./ExampleCMSView";

export default function App() {
    const productCollection = buildCollection({
        name: "Product",
        properties: {
            name: {
                name: "Name",
                validation: { required: true },
                dataType: "string",
            },
        },
    });

    const customViews: CMSView[] = [
        {
            path: "additional",
            name: "Additional view",
            description: "This is an example of an additional view that is defined by the user",
            // This can be any React component
            view: <ExampleCMSView />,
        },
    ];

    return (
        <FirebaseCMSApp
            name={"My Online Shop"}
            collections={({ user }: EntityCollectionsBuilder) => [
                buildCollection({
                    path: "products",
                    collection: productCollection,
                    name: "Products",
                }),
            ]}
            views={customViews}
        />
    );
}
```

Your custom view is implemented as any regular React component that uses
some hooks provided by the CMS:

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import MyComponentSource from "!!raw-loader!../../../samples/samples_v2/ExampleCMSView";

<CodeBlock language="tsx">{MyComponentSource}</CodeBlock>
