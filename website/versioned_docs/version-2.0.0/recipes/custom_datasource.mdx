FireCMS is based on the idea of **declarative** data sources. This means that
you can define your collections and entities in a declarative way, and FireCMS
will take care of the rest. We provide a default datasource that works with
Firestore, but you can also use your own data sources.

## Custom data sources

FireCMS allows you to use your own data sources. This is useful if you want to
use FireCMS with a different database, or if you want to use a different
Firestore instance.

Data sources are implemented as objects that implement the
[`DataSource`] interface.

Since FireCMS is a CMS based on React, you can use the hooks provided by FireCMS to
develop your own data sources.

The default datasource is implemented in the [`useFirestoreDataSource`]
hook. You can call this hook from your own data source to get the default
implementation and extend it. When defining your own data source, you need
to implement all the methods defined in the [`DataSource`]
interface.

## Example custom datasource

Let's define a custom data source that will allow us to override the default
implementation when fetching and saving data for a specific path only:

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import CustomDataSource from "!!raw-loader!../../../samples/samples_v2/recipes/custom_datasource/custom_datasource";

<CodeBlock language="tsx">{CustomDataSource}</CodeBlock>

## Using a custom data source

Once you have defined your custom data source, you can use it in your
custom [`FireCMS`] instance (keep in mind that you can't use a
custom data source with `FirebaseCMSApp`).

You will need to create a custom app, and use your custom data source when
creating the `FireCMS` instance.

Check the [Custom CMS app](../custom_cms_app) instructions to learn how to create a custom app.
Replace the `useFirestoreDataSource` hook with your custom data source.

You can also customise in the same way the other components used internally by
FireCMS.
