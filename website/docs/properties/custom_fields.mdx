description: FireCMS custom fields elevate your forms with bespoke elements tailored precisely to your needs. By incorporating a React component into a property's `propertyConfig`, you gain full control over the field's rendering and logic. Minimum requirements include displaying `value` and employing `setValue` to update the property. Conveniently, custom props can be defined and received within your field component, and for more complex scenarios, the `context` within FieldProps provides access to the entity's full values. The example illustrates a custom TextField influenced by a background color prop, showcasing the flexibility and creativity allowed by custom fields. These personalized inputs are integral for crafting a content management system that aligns perfectly with your unique project requirements.

Custom fields allow you to customize the field that it is displayed in the
form, related to a specific property. These fields use your own logic to
render the corresponding view, and are responsible for updating the underlying
property value.

    style={{
        maxWidth: "100%",
        width: "640px",
        margin: "32px 0px 32px",
        alignSelf: "center",
    }}
    loop

</video>

If you need a custom field for your property you can do it by passing a React
component to the `propertyConfig` prop of a property `config`. The React component must
accept the props of type [`FieldProps`](../api/interfaces/FieldProps).
The bare minimum you need to implement
is a field that displays the received `value` and uses the `setValue` callback.

You can also pass custom props to your custom field, which you then receive in
the `customProps` prop.

If you are developing a custom field and need to access the values of the
entity, you can use the `context` field in FieldProps.

You can check all the props [`FieldProps`](../api/interfaces/FieldProps).

## Example

This is an example of a custom TextField that takes the background color as a prop

```tsx
import React from "react";
import { FieldHelperText, FieldProps, useModeController } from "@firecms/core";
import { TextField } from "@firecms/ui";

// you can define the props that your custom field will receive
interface CustomColorTextFieldProps {
    color: string;
}

export default function CustomColorTextField({
    property,
    value,
    setValue,
    setFieldValue,
    customProps,
    touched,
    includeDescription,
    showError,
    error,
    isSubmitting,
    context, // the rest of the entity values here
    ...props
}: FieldProps<string, CustomColorTextFieldProps>) {
    const { mode } = useModeController();
    const backgroundColor = customProps?.color ?? (mode === "light" ? "#eef4ff" : "#16325f");
    return (
        <>
            <TextField
                inputStyle={{
                    backgroundColor,
                }}
                error={!!error}
                disabled={isSubmitting}
                label={error ?? property.name}
                value={value ?? ""}
                onChange={(evt: any) => {
                    setValue(evt.target.value);
                }}
            />

            <FieldHelperText
                includeDescription={includeDescription}
                showError={showError}
                error={error}
                property={property}
            />
        </>
    );
}
```

...and how it is used:

```tsx
export const blogCollection = buildCollection({
    id: "blog",
    path: "blog",
    name: "Blog entry",
    properties: {
        // ...
        gold_text: {
            name: "Gold text",
            description: "This field is using a custom component defined by the developer",
            dataType: "string",
            Field: CustomColorTextField,
            customProps: {
                color: "gold", // pass the custom prop
            },
        },
    },
});
```
